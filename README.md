# Comments-Classification-01  

This repository contains code, notebooks, and documentation for my participation in the **Kaggle Comment Classification Competition**.  
The goal of the competition is to predict the probabilities for each text sample belonging to multiple categories—**Complaint, Demands, Praise, and Questions**—using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.  

## Project Overview  

### Objective  
Build a **multi-label classification model** to predict the likelihood that a given comment falls into one or more of the specified categories.  

## Dataset  
- **train.csv** – Contains text samples with binary labels indicating whether each sample belongs to a specific category.  
- **test.csv** – Contains text samples for which predictions need to be generated.  
- **sample_submission.csv** – Provides the required format for submission, including the unique identifier and predicted probabilities for each category.  

## Techniques and Libraries  

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`  
- **Text Processing:** Regular expressions, `NLTK`  
- **Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF vectorization, word embeddings  
- **Modeling:**  
  - `scikit-learn` (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
  - Deep learning frameworks (`TensorFlow/Keras`) for advanced modeling  
- **Evaluation:** AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) for multi-label classification  
- **Submission:** Using **Kaggle API** for downloading data and submitting predictions  

## Future Improvements  

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  - Implement advanced hyperparameter tuning strategies (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search) for model optimization.  

- **Ensemble Methods:**  
  - Experiment with ensemble techniques to blend predictions from multiple models.  

- **Deep Learning Approaches:**  
  - Explore advanced NLP models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer-based models) to further improve prediction performance.
